# Ar-IOT

Project is an experiment in combining Augmented Reality with IOT.
The solution will be a composition of:
AR-Application developed in Swift for IOS.
SensorServer running on Raspberry Pi 3 using Windows IOT
Software for reading sensor values running on an Arduino Leonardo.

project files will be added the next few days.



Overview of subprojects:
