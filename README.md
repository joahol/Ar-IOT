# Ar-IOT

Project is an experiment of combining AugmentedReality with IoT.
The folder SensorServer contains to early version of servers which is designed for running on Win IoT Core
RaspberryServer is a server reading values from an Arduino. 
EasyServer is a simple web server for serving values from the RaspberryServer
Mainpage.xaml app is only kept for debugging.
Additionaly there is an early prototype for an swift app added here, but only the mainclasses are published at this point.
The code in this project is by no means finished, it is an ongoing project and is a bit buggy.
